# AI Assistant Guide

**This file has been merged with AGENTS.md.**

Please refer to **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** for the complete AI assistant guide for this project.

## Why the change?

To maintain consistency and reduce duplication, we now use a single canonical documentation file for all AI assistants and automated agents working on this codebase.

**→ See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for:**
- Project overview and architecture
- Development workflows and code conventions
- Important patterns and best practices
- Build, deployment, and testing guidelines
- AI assistant guidelines and common tasks
